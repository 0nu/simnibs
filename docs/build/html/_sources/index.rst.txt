SimNIBS 
=======


**SimNIBS** is a free and open source software package for the Simulation of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation. It allows for realistic calculations of the electric field induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electric stimulation (TES).

SimNIBS is being developed at ... logos here with support of our international collaborators

A SimNIBS workflow consists of three main parts:
   * :ref:`Generate high-quality head models <head_modeling_tutorial>` from MR images
   * Set up and run simulation in the :ref:`graphical user interface <gui_tutorial>`, :ref:`MATLAB or Python<scripting_tutorial>`
   * :ref:`Visualize simulation results <visualization_tutorial>`, and transform them to *FsAverage* or *MNI* space.
